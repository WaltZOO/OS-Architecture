## Overview

This repository contains our work on the educational operating system **Nanvix**, developed for academic purposes.

Nanvix is a lightweight, POSIX-compliant operating system kernel designed by Pedro H. Penna and collaborators. It is non-preemptive, Unix System V based, and includes key features such as virtual memory, time-sharing, interprocess communication, and a Minix-style file system.  
More information on the Nanvix OS can be found on the official repository: https://github.com/nanvix/nanvix

## Our Contributions

We worked on extending Nanvix by implementing and exploring the following core components:

### 1. Scheduling Algorithms
We explored multiple scheduling strategies on separate branches:
- **Priority Scheduling** (`priority` branch):  
  Processes are selected based on a user-defined `nice` value. In case of equal priorities, a round-robin strategy is applied.
- **Lottery Scheduling** (`lottery` branch):  
  Each process is assigned a number of "tickets" proportionally to its priority. A winning ticket is drawn randomly to select the next process.
- **Multiple Queues Scheduling** (`multiple_queues` branch):  
  Processes are distributed into two queues based on execution time. The first queue is prioritized with a priority scheduler, while the second queue uses FIFO.

### 2. Semaphore Implementation
Branch: `semaphore2`

We implemented kernel-level semaphores to manage access to shared resources. This includes:
- Creation and destruction of semaphores
- Up/Down (P/V) operations
- System call interfaces (`semget`, `semctl`, `semop`)
- Basic queue system to handle blocking/unblocking of processes

### 3. Security Enhancements
Branch: `security`

Key improvements to OS security included:
- **Multiuser support** with user creation
- **User process limits** to prevent forkbombs (max processes per user)
- **Login interface** that lists system users
- **Password cracking simulation** (brute-force script)
- **`su` command** to change the effective user ID after authentication
- **`passwd` command** to change user passwords
- **Password dictionary check** to reject commonly used passwords

## Repository Structure

All our contributions are organized in branches:
- `priority`
- `lottery`
- `multiple_queues`
- `semaphore2`
- `security`

You can switch branches to explore the implementations individually.
